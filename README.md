# Fake News Detection Using LSTM Model

This project is a machine learning application designed to detect fake news articles using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The LSTM model is trained on textual data and predicts whether a news article is fake or real.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes LSTM for sequence analysis and text classification.
- **Embedding Layer**: Converts text data into dense vector representations.
- **Binary Classification**: Outputs a probability indicating whether the news article is fake or not.
